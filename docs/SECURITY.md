# InstaFlow Security Best Practices Guide

This document provides important security guidelines for using InstaFlow safely and effectively while protecting your Instagram accounts.

> **IMPORTANT**: Using automation tools with Instagram carries inherent risks, including potential account restrictions or bans. These guidelines are designed to minimize those risks, but cannot eliminate them entirely. Always use InstaFlow responsibly and in accordance with Instagram's Terms of Service.

## Account Protection

### Account Health Monitoring

- **Regularly check account status**: Monitor for any warnings from Instagram about unusual activity.
- **Track account metrics**: Watch for sudden drops in engagement, which might indicate shadowbanning.
- **Maintain a natural profile**: Ensure your account has a complete profile with profile picture and bio.
- **Alternate automation with manual activity**: Mix automated actions with regular manual usage of your account.

### Action Balance

- **Maintain healthy ratios**: Keep a balanced ratio between following and followers (ideally close to 1:1).
- **Diversify actions**: Don't focus exclusively on one action type (e.g., only following). Mix follows, unfollows, likes, and comments.
- **Content interaction**: Regularly interact with content in your feed to mimic natural behavior.

## Credential Management

### Secure Storage

- **Use environment variables**: Store credentials in environment variables rather than in code or configuration files.
- **Create a .env file**: Use a `.env` file for local development, but ensure it's in your `.gitignore`.
- **Never commit credentials**: Ensure credentials are never committed to version control.

### Example .env File Setup

```
INSTAGRAM_USERNAME=your_username
INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD=your_password
COOKIE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_secure_key_here
```

### Encryption

- **Encrypt stored cookies**: Always use the built-in encryption for storing cookies.
- **Generate strong encryption keys**: Use a secure random generator for your `COOKIE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.
- **Rotate encryption keys**: Periodically change your encryption keys, especially on shared systems.

## Rate Limiting & Anti-Detection

### Action Limits

- **Start conservatively**: Begin with very conservative limits and gradually increase them.
- **Follow Instagram's known limits**: 
  - Maximum ~150 follows/unfollows per day
  - Maximum ~200 likes per day
  - Maximum ~20 comments per day
  - Maximum ~10-20 DMs per day to new users
- **Spread actions throughout the day**: Avoid performing all actions in a short time window.

### Delay Settings

- **Use random delays**: Always use random delays between actions to mimic human behavior.
- **Longer delays for sensitive actions**: Use longer delays for follow/unfollow actions than for likes.
- **Respect time zones**: Reduce or stop activity during typical sleeping hours for your account's time zone.

### Setting Appropriate Delays

| Action Type | Minimum Delay | Maximum Delay |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| Likes       | 15-30 seconds | 40-60 seconds |
| Follows     | 30-60 seconds | 70-90 seconds |
| Comments    | 60-120 seconds | 180-300 seconds |
| DMs         | 120-300 seconds | 500-900 seconds |

## Proxy Usage

### When to Use Proxies

- **Multiple accounts**: If managing multiple accounts from the same IP address.
- **High-volume usage**: If performing a high volume of actions.
- **After warnings**: If you've received warnings from Instagram about suspicious activity.

### Proxy Configuration

- **Use high-quality proxies**: Avoid free proxies as they're often flagged by Instagram.
- **Residential proxies**: Use residential proxies rather than datacenter proxies when possible.
- **Dedicated proxies**: If affordable, use dedicated proxies rather than shared proxies.
- **Geographic consideration**: Use proxies in the same geographic area as your normal account access.

### Setting Up Proxies

```
# In .env file
PROXY_HOST=proxy.example.com
PROXY_PORT=8080
PROXY_USERNAME=your_proxy_username
PROXY_PASSWORD=your_proxy_password
```

## Cookie Security

### Cookie Management

- **Encrypt stored cookies**: InstaFlow encrypts cookies by default when the `COOKIE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is set.
- **Store in a secure location**: Ensure cookie files are stored in a directory with proper permissions.
- **Clear cookies periodically**: Don't rely on the same cookies indefinitely; log in fresh occasionally.

### Cookie Storage Location

By default, InstaFlow stores cookies in the `data/cookies` directory with filenames based on the username. Ensure this directory has appropriate permissions:

```bash
# Set proper permissions
chmod 700 data/cookies
```

## Application Security

### Installation Security

- **Use virtual environments**: Always install InstaFlow in a Python virtual environment.
- **Verify dependencies**: Check the dependencies for any security issues before installing.
- **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update dependencies to get security patches.

### Execution Environment

- **Limit permissions**: Run InstaFlow with minimal system permissions needed.
- **Isolated environment**: Consider running in a container or virtual machine for added isolation.
- **Secure your workspace**: Ensure your development or execution environment is secure.

## Dealing with Instagram Limitations

### Handling Blocks and Restrictions

- **Temporary blocks**: If you receive a temporary block, stop all automation for at least 24-48 hours.
- **Action blocks**: If specific actions are blocked, avoid those actions for a minimum of 3-7 days.
- **Use the emergency stop feature**: Enable InstaFlow's emergency stop when you detect blocks or warnings.

### Avoiding Shadowbans

- **Don't use banned hashtags**: Regularly check if hashtags you're using are banned or restricted.
- **Limit hashtag usage**: Use no more than 20-30 hashtags per post.
- **Diversify interactions**: Don't interact with the same accounts repeatedly in a short period.

## Emergency Procedures

### When to Stop Automation

- **After receiving warnings**: If Instagram sends any warning notifications.
- **Unusual login requirements**: If Instagram frequently asks for verification when logging in.
- **Engagement drops dramatically**: If you notice a sudden drop in engagement across your posts.

### Recovery Steps

1. **Stop all automation immediately**
2. **Log in manually**: Access your account through the official Instagram app or website
3. **Check for warnings**: Look for any warning messages or restrictions
4. **Reduce action limits**: When resuming automation, cut your action limits by 50-75%
5. **Increase delays**: Double all delay settings when resuming

### Using Emergency Stop

InstaFlow includes an emergency stop feature that will automatically pause all operations if suspicious activity is detected:

```python
# Emergency stop is enabled by default
# You can configure thresholds in settings:

# In config/default.json
{
  "safety": {
    "emergency_threshold": 0.6,  // Success rate threshold
    "warning_limit": 5           // Number of warnings before emergency stop
  }
}
```

## Updating & Maintenance

### Keeping InstaFlow Updated

- **Check for updates regularly**: Monitor the InstaFlow repository for updates and security patches.
- **Update gradually**: Test new versions in a controlled environment before updating production.
- **Read changelogs**: Pay attention to security-related changes in the changelog.
- **Back up your configuration**: Always back up your configuration files before updating.
- **Follow a test protocol**: Establish a protocol for testing updates before full deployment.

### Monitoring and Logging

- **Review logs regularly**: Check InstaFlow logs for warnings, errors, and suspicious patterns.
- **Set appropriate log levels**: Use DEBUG level during testing and INFO or WARNING in production.
- **Secure log files**: Ensure log files don't contain sensitive information and have proper permissions.
- **Implement alerts**: Set up alerts for critical errors or emergency stops.

### Regular Maintenance Tasks

| Task | Frequency | Description |

| Log review | Daily | Check logs for errors or warnings |
| Cookie refresh | Weekly | Perform a fresh login to refresh cookies |
